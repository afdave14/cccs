pacman1.14.py should be the only .py file when you open the folder.

Honestly a great course! Nice and relaxing pace of a 100 level course but you still learn plenty, especially if you are pushing yourself. I hope you keep this class for future students. If you need help pitching it to other students in the future, let me know and I will try to convince them.
