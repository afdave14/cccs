Let $n \geq 0$.
We choose $x = a^{2^n}$.
Note that $x \in A_3$ and $|x| = 2^n \geq n$.

Let $x = uvw$ with $|uv| \leq n$ and $|v| > 0$.
We want to choose $i_0$ such that
\[
u v^{i_0} w \not\in A_3
\]

[The strategy that we hope will work is to
show that $2^n < |uv^{i_0}w| < 2^{n+1}$.]

Note that 
\[
|u v^{i_0} w| = 2^n + (i_0 - 1)|v|
\]
Since $|v| > 0$ if we choose $i_0$ such that
\[
i_0 - 1 \geq 1
\]
then we must have
\[
2^n < 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |v|
\]
We also have
\[
|v| \leq |uv| 
\]
Therefore
\[
2^n < 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |v| \leq 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |uv| 
\]
We also know that $|uv| \leq n$.
Therefore
\[
2^n < 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |v| \leq 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |uv| \leq 2^n + (i_0 - 1) n
\]
Therefore if we choose $i_0$ such that
\[
(i_0 - 1) n < 2^n
\]
then we have
\[
2^n < 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |v| \leq 2^n + (i_0 - 1) n < 2^n + 2^n = 2\cdot 2^n 
= 2^{n+1}
\]
Altogether we have to choose $i_0$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i_0 - 1 \geq 1$
\item $(i_0 - 1) n < 2^n$
\end{enumerate}
If we choose $i_0 = 2$
both conditions are indeed
satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i_0 - 1 = 2 - 1 \geq 1$
\item $(i_0 - 1) n = (2 - 1) n = n < 2^n$
\end{enumerate}
[The fact that $n < 2^n$ (for $n \geq 0$) can be shown easily.]
In that case we have
\[
2^n < 2^n + (i_0 - 1) |v| < 2^{n+1}
\]
and therefore $uv^{i_0}w \underline{\not \in} A_3$ 

By the pumping lemma for regular languages,
$A_3$ is not regular.
